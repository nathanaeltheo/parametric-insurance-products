# parametric-insurance-products

**Summary**
This is a team project for SOA Business Case Competition 2021. We designed a parametric insurance product that fits the needs of Ambernia and Polominia citizens and bring great impact for the company. We implemented several statistical methods such as Bayesian concepts to measure risk for every disease and forecast expected revenue and its sensitivity.
